1. What benefits does unit testing provide over testing a program as a whole?

Testing the program in the whole is difficult, because it is hard to identify exactly what part of the program breaks down when it doesn't work. Unit testing allows you to isolate problem functions.

2. Your MPs have been graded by autograders. Do the autograders perform black
   box testing or white box testing? Explain your answer.

Autograders perform black box testing. They have set inputs and check to see that the program returns an expected output, regardless of how it got there.

3. Describe at least one pessimistic test case for programming problem 2 on
   midterm 2 day 1 (rawFloat multiplication).

Using a made up struct as parameters for the method to see if it breaks or gives an error.

4.     float result = my_sin(360.0);
       assert(result == 0.0);

   The assert in the above code snippet is too strict. Assume the
   specification allows my_sin to be off by at most 0.01. How should the
   assert statement be modified to reflect this? (Hint: You may use the fabs()
   absolute value function.)

   float result == my_sin(360.0);
   assert(result - 0 <= fabs(.01));
